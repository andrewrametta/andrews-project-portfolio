            <p>Allow myself to introduce…myself. Hi, I am Andrew Rametta. I am a new software developer living in Tampa, FL. I spent the first part of my career in the nonprofit world and my main motivator is still helping make people’s lives better.</p>
            <p>I am looking for a great organization with a great team to join. I bring a unique perspective and a fresh eye. My favorite thing about software development is knowing I will never know everything. I am a life long learner and it excites me to know that learning is a part of the job.</p>

            <h2>A little about me...</h2>
            <p>I became a software developer because I wanted a career that require me to use my brain everyday. I enjoy solving problems and difficult challenges. I like getting suck because I know with each failure there is a learning that will stick. I enjoy working with others and truly believe that 2 heads are better then 1. (Well, most of the time) I think having a diverse group of people with vastly different perspectives make for the most creative teams with the greatest results.</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding I am usually sweating in a small hot dark room without a computer. Yoga is one thing I can’t go a day without. Another thing I can’t go a day without is reading <i>Goodnight Moon</i> for the 15th time to my 16 month son. The kitchen is my favorite room in the house. I often spend an evening opening up the fridge and pretending I competing on an episode of Chopped.</p>
